// Workshop Week 3a: 
// 1. Write a program in C to take two numbers from the user and print the 
// maximum between two numbers using a pointer. 
// #include<stdio.h>
// #include<math.h>
// void swap(int *, int *);
// int main() {
//     int n1, n2;

//     printf("Enter a first number :");
//     scanf("%d", &n1);

//     printf("Enter a Second number : ");
//     scanf("%d", &n2);

//     if (n1 > n2) {
//         printf("First number is greater.");
//     } else {
//         printf("Second number is greater.");
//     }


//     return 0;
// }
// void num(int *p, int *q) {
//     int temp;
//     temp = *p;
//     *p = *q;
//     *q =temp;

// }






// 2. Write a program to count and find the sum of all the numbers in the array 
// which are exactly divisible by 7 and not divisible by 2 and 3. 
// #include<stdio.h>
// #include<math.h>
// int main() {
//     let
//     int n ;


//     return 0;
// }







// 3. Write a program to initialize an integer array with values {10,5,7,91,54,24}. 
// Pass this array to a function. If element is found, print out its index number 
// and if element is not found then display the message “Element Not found” in 
// the function. 


// 4. Write a program to read three integers using an array and find the smallest 
// and largest among them.You must write a function for finding the largest and 
// smallest integer and the result must be displayed in the main function itself. 

#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
int main () {
    int n1, n2, n3 , n4;
    printf("Enter a first number : ");
    scanf("%d" &n1);

    printf("Enter a Second number : ");
    scanf("%d" &n2);

    printf("Enter a Third number : ");
    scanf("")
    return 0;
}


// You are not allowed to create global variables. 
// 5. Write a program to take three numbers from the user and save it in three 
// different variables. You must swap the value of three numbers using 
// function. You must use call by references.
// Workshop Week 3b:
// 1. Write a program in C to take three numbers from the user and print the sum, 
// multiplication, quotient, subtraction and minimum between three numbers 
// using a pointer. 
// 2. Write a program to count and find the sum of all the numbers in the array 
// which are exactly divisible by 5 and not divisible by 2 and 3. 
// 3. Write a program to replace each element in an array with the integer value 5. 
// You must take input from users in the main function and save it in an array. 
// You must also take the size of an array from the user. You must create a 
// function that takes two parameters: an array and length of the array. Your 
// function should not return anything and it should not print anything. You 
// must print before and after replacing an element in an array in the main 
// function. 
// 4. Add a new function in the program you have created in Qno. 3 which takes 
// three parameters: an array, length of the array and value to replace each 
// element in an array. You must receive an integer value in the main function. 
// Your function should not return anything and it should not print anything. 
// You must print a new array in the main function.
// Workshop Week 3c: 
// 1. Write a program in C to take two numbers from the user and print the 
// minimum between two numbers using a pointer. 
// 2. Write a program to count and find the sum of all the numbers in the array, 
// which are exactly divisible by 5 and not divisible by 2 and 3. Assign an array 
// to a pointer. Print out address of pointer, array and first element of an array 
// using “%p” formatter. 
// 3. Write a program to initialize an integer array with values {20, 15, 87, 71, 24, 
// 34}. Pass this array to a function. Take input from a user to search a number 
// from an array. If element is found, print out its index number and if element 
// is not found then display the message “Element Not found” in the function. 
// 4. Write a program to read three integers using an array and find the smallest 
// and largest among them. You must write a function for finding the largest 
// and smallest integer and the result must be displayed in the main function 
// itself. You are not allowed to create global variables.
